   - **Interest Keywords**: Comma-separated keywords used to filter users.
     - Example: `"Data Science, AI, Machine Learning"`
   - **Model Path**: Path to your trained ML model file (e.g., `logistic_model.pkl`)
   - **Max Profiles**: Number of profiles to scrape in one session (e.g., `500`)
   - **Max Invites**: Number of invites to send per session (e.g., `20`)

## Safety Guidelines (READ CAREFULLY)

- **DO NOT** send more than ~100 invites per week.
- Avoid scraping 1000+ profiles in one session.
- Let the automation run in **small, random batches**.
- Default settings are designed to be conservative.
- Do not run 24/7 or from multiple IPs — **be human**.

## Tips for Config

- `target_label` must match what you see on LinkedIn exactly.
- `interest_keywords` help you narrow down to relevant leads.
- You can experiment with different models by setting `model_path`.
