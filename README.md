# üï∏AutoConnect ‚Äì ML-Powered Outreach Tool

**AutoConnect** is a Python-based desktop tool for automating cold LinkedIn outreach.

It scrapes profiles, predicts who‚Äôs most likely to accept a connection using a basic ML model, and sends invites ‚Äî all controlled through a simple GUI.

This is an end-to-end prototype: scraping, feature engineering, modeling, automation, GUI, and bundling as a Linux AppImage.

> It's my first project like this ‚Äî leaving behind Jupyter notebooks and gluing everything together into a real, working app.  
> It's not perfect, but the core functionality works. Consider this a rough MVP, so enjoy?
