# AutoConnect – ML-Powered LinkedIn Outreach Tool

**AutoConnect** is a Python-based desktop tool for automating cold LinkedIn outreach.

It scrapes profiles, predicts who’s most likely to accept a connection using a basic ML model, and sends invites — all controlled through a simple GUI.

This is an end-to-end prototype: scraping, feature engineering, modeling, automation, GUI, and bundling as a Linux AppImage.
